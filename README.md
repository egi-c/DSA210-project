## Instagram Usage Analysis  
Motivation  
I want to analyze my Instagram usage patterns to better understand how I interact with content on the platform. Instagram is my primary social media, and by examining my activity, I aim to discover more about the types of content I engage with, how often I post, and how my interactions change over time. This will help me learn more about my online behavior and how Instagram fits into my daily life.

Approach  
To gather data, I will use two main sources:  

Instagram Data Export: Requesting my data from Instagram will provide details about the accounts I follow, the posts Iâ€™ve liked and commented on, and my personal posts.
Instagram API: Using the Instagram Graph API, I will scrape additional data, such as engagement metrics (likes, comments, follower counts) for my posts over time.
Tools
The following tools will be used to process and analyze the data:  

Jupyter Notebook: For coding and documenting the analysis.  
Pandas: For cleaning and organizing the data.  
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations and exploring patterns in my Instagram usage.  
Numpy & Scipy: For statistical analysis of my activity.  
Data Processing  
Once I collect the data, I will clean and structure it:  

Data Cleaning:  
Remove any unnecessary information (e.g., personal details) from the data.  
Adjust timestamps to my local time zone.  

Focus on Key Metrics:  
Likes and comments on my posts.  
Follower growth over time.  

Merging Data:    
Merge engagement data (likes, comments, etc.) with my posts to identify which types of content get more interaction.  

Data Visualization  
I will create visualizations to explore the following patterns in my Instagram activity:  

Engagement Trends:  
Visualize how my likes and comments change over time.  

Follower Growth:   
Analyze trends in how my follower count increases or decreases.  

Content Type Analysis:  
Explore which types of posts (e.g., photos, videos, stories) receive the most engagement.  

Expected Outcomes  
Through this project, I aim to gain a clearer understanding of my Instagram usage, identify patterns in how I engage with content, and make more intentional decisions about how I interact with the platform.
