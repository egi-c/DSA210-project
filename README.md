# DSA210-project

I’ve always found it interesting to reflect on how I interact with the world around me,
especially through the services I rely on every day. Getir has become a regular part of
my routine—it’s where I turn when I need groceries, snacks, or just that one thing I forgot to pick up earlier.

This project is a way for me to take a closer look at my habits and preferences.
What am I ordering the most? When do I tend to place my orders? How often am I using the app? 
By analyzing these patterns, I hope to get a better sense of how Getir fits into my life and what my choices say about me.
Who knows, maybe I’ll even learn something surprising about myself—like why I always seem to order chocolate at midnight!
